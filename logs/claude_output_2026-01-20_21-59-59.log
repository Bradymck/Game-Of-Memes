The system is working as designed: it's blocking me from making changes.\n\n## What You Need to Do\n\n**Stop sending PROMPT.md** and instead:\n\n**Option A: Fix Permissions** (if you want Ralph to work)\n```bash\n# Edit this file:\nnano /Users/bradymckenna/Documents/game-of-memes/.claude/settings.local.json\n\n# Change from:\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\"Bash(tree:*)\", \"Bash(cat:*)\", ...]\n  }\n}\n\n# To:\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Bash(tree:*)\",\n      \"Bash(cat:*)\",\n      \"Bash(npm run build:*)\",\n      \"Bash(npm run lint:*)\",\n      \"Bash(find:*)\",\n      \"Bash(npm ls:*)\",\n      \"Bash(ls:*)\",\n      \"Bash(mkdir:*)\",\n      \"Write\",\n      \"Edit\",\n      \"Bash(git:*)\",\n      \"Read\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Option B: Use the Documentation** (fastest solution)\n```bash\ncat docs/generated/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n# Follow the guides I created - they have exact code\n```\n\n**Option C: Accept the Current State**\n- Ralph completed all design work\n- ~8 hours of planning condensed into docs\n- 68 minutes of implementation time remaining\n- All code is ready, just needs copy-paste\n\n## My Recommendation\n\n**End this Ralph session.** I've done everything possible without Write permissions. Sending PROMPT.md repeatedly won't change the technical limitation.\n\nEither fix the permissions file manually, or use the comprehensive documentation I created to implement the features yourself.\n\n---\n\n```\n---RALPH_STATUS---\nSTATUS: BLOCKED\nTASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 0\nFILES_MODIFIED: 0\nTESTS_STATUS: PASSING\nWORK_TYPE: DOCUMENTATION\nEXIT_SIGNAL: false\nRECOMMENDATION: Human must fix .claude/settings.local.json or implement manually - Ralph cannot proceed\n---END_RALPH_STATUS---\n```","session_id":"4e57cb27-99df-457a-9496-3e171fe18182","total_cost_usd":0.50624485,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":130763,"cache_read_input_tokens":12222,"output_tokens":706,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":130763}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":763,"outputTokens":171,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.001618,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":3,"outputTokens":706,"cacheReadInputTokens":12222,"cacheCreationInputTokens":130763,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.50462685,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"f5d09abe-fc80-4b71-b9d5-91f9473256a1"}
