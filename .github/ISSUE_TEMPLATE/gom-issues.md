## **Description**: 
Is this a proposal to host a "Play Test", a proposal to work on a 'Bounty Task', 'Feature Request', or a 'Game Issue'?  

## **Purpose**: 
Describe your issue or proposal in detail. Please include any relevant notes or details.  

## **Description**: 
Describe the details of your issue or proposal. Please include images, video, or other content. Be as descriptive as possible to help us make a decision on this ticket.  

If this is a task proposal, please be as descriptive as possible about what you want to do.

## **Ethereum Address**:
Be sure it is an ethereum address that you control the private key to, tokens sent to an exchange will be lost. This will be where the bounty is sent.

**Note**:  For a task proposal, it's encouraged to use a DAO, multi sig, or some other form of group address for your proposals to show that you have plans for your bounty that encourage or promote either community growth or token distribution to new people. These types of proposals will be favored, especially if you invite a Game admin to the multisig/DAO prior to submitting your proposal.
